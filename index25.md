## Workshop Desciption

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), with the rapid development of advanced sensing, data storage, data analytics, and high-performance computing technologies, both manufacturing industries and healthcare systems are experiencing a data‑driven revolution. However, the unique characteristics of manufacturing and healthcare systems prevent the direct application of existing data-driven methods. Their characteristics include (1) systematic physical principles, (2) high demand for interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness, and (3) limited computation resources and the need for instant decision-making. These characteristics raised pressing needs to develop domain-aware data-driven approaches for critical tasks in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as smart diagnosis, automatic control, design optimization, customized analytics, etc.

This workshop aims to demonstrate the recent research progress of data science, which focuses on addressing the unique challenges in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as the gaps in data quality/security assurance, domain-aware data analytics, improvement of trustworthiness, etc. We cordially invite submissions that focus on recent advances in research/development of data science, which are motivated by real-world problems in manufacturing and healthcare. Papers and/or posters focus on both theoretical foundations and applications are welcomed from the areas including but not limited to:

## Keynote Speakers

* **Title: Automatic Anomaly Detection at Supercomputing Scale**
Garrett T. Kenyon, Rusty Davis, Matt Sheats, Nathan Debardeleben
Los Alamos National Laboratory

**Abstract:** 
Automating the detection of defects in CT scans of manufactured parts is perhaps best thought of as an example of anomaly detection. The number of potential defects is effectively infinite; almost anything that can go wrong in the fabrication process probably will go wrong at some point, and we require an algorithm capable of detecting that “something isn’t right” regardless of what that something is. An additional complication is that at very high resolution, CT scan volumes become enormous, often hundreds of gigabytes, making this a supercomputing problem. We have been approaching the problem of automatic anomaly detection at supercomputing scale using a technique derived from sparse coding. We start by training a set of convolutional 3-dimensional features that are optimized for the sparse reconstruction of “defect-free” manufactured parts. One may think of these 3-dimensional features as puzzle pieces that are optimized for reassembling representative CT scan volumes using as few puzzle pieces as possible. Because the algorithm struggles to reconstruct manufacturing defects using 3-dimensional features optimized for the sparse reconstruction of “defect-free” parts, defects show up as large residual errors. We are using PetaVision, a high-performance neural network simulator, to train sparse coding models on large CT scan volumes. PetaVision employs halos to split large CT scan volumes into smaller components, with each component distributed to a separate node and MPI used to pass halos to nearest neighbors, thereby coordinating the operations performed on individual nodes. PetaVision utilizes a hybrid approach to parallelism, employing MPI, openMP and GPU acceleration where available. Our preliminary studies indicate that Trinity KNL nodes are approximately a factor of 10 slower than Power 9 GPU nodes and that Nvidia A1000 GPU nodes are a factor of 10 faster still.

* **Title: Trustworthy Decision Making in the Real World with Uncertainty Quantification**

**Abstract:** 
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has currently achieved success in prediction and control tasks such as gaming, robotics, and language models, igniting curiosity about its applicability in real-world scenarios. This presentation focuses on deep RL for real-world decision-making, commencing with an exploration of potential applications and the challenges posed by uncertainty inherent in data and models. We will then discuss the implications of these uncertainties on the feasibility of prediction and control in real-world contexts. We will also share preliminary efforts aimed at addressing these challenges in applications such as sensor placement and policy evaluation.

* **Title: Data-quality-aware Graph Machine Learning**

**Abstract:** 
Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in real-world applications (e.g., social networks, infrastructure, biomedical, etc.) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) has become a prominent method for handling graph-based data. Despite GML’s remarkable achievements, its reliance on node features and graph topology makes it susceptible to data quality challenges. Therefore, my research has focused on data-quality-aware graph machine learning, systematically examining issues related to topology, imbalance, and bias in graph data and proposing data/model-centric solutions to handle them. Furthermore, I have developed dedicated GML for many real-world application domains, such as computer-aided drug discovery, information retrieval on e-commerce platforms, and enhancing the reading experience for educational purposes. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of my research contributions while more thoroughly introducing my work on improved multi-document question-answering via knowledge graph with an LLM agent. In conclusion, I will highlight multiple future directions.
